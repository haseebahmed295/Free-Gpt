- Automatically runs the code generated by ChatGPT
- No Blender freezing up
- See live response in console
- Records the chat history
- Cool UI

## Installation:
1. Launch Blender, then select the Preferences option. To accomplish this, select **Edit > Preferences**.
2. Choose the **Add-ons** tab from the Preferences menu. A list of all installed add-ons for your Blender application is shown on this screen.
3. Click on the **Install** button on the top right corner of the Preferences window.
4. Select the **Free Gpt** add-on file that you downloaded.
5. After the installation is finished, choose the checkbox next to **Free Gpt** in the Add-ons list to activate it.

## Usage:
- The addon utilizes free internet service providers. Try a different model if one of the add-on models doesn't work. Kindly let me know about the failure.
- The addon runs code generated by the model automatically. In case of any error in the script, the error part is saved as a comment on the last line of the code. You can try to comment on the model to fix the issue in the last response. Some of the models may not work as they do not support context-awareness.
